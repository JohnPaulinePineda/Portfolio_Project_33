This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_33/) explores the various principal component-based dimensionality reduction algorithms for extracting and visualizing information. Methods applied in the analysis to transform and reduce high dimensional data included the Principal Component Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Multiple Factor Analysis and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data. The algorithms were separately applied on different iterations of the original dataset as appropriate to the given method, with the correlation plots, factorial maps and biplots (as applicable) formulated for a more intuitive visualization of the extracted dimensions.
